    "class is a blueprint for creating objects , providing initial values for state member variables or attributes and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). \n",
    "#### 2. Object\n",
    "An object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables.\n",
    "#### 3. Attribute\n",
    "Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance.\n",
    "In short attributes store information about the instance.\n",
    "#### 4. Behavior\n",
    "The behavior of an object is defined by its methods,\n",
